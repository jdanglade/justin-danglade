        "I was born and raised in Miami Florida. Interestingly enough, I don't speak Spanish, but I do know a couple of programming languages like C/C++ and JavaScript. I got my associates degree at Miami Dade College and while I was there, I took up a job as a tutor. At first, I provided tutoring for CGS1060, a basic Microsoft Office course that was, for the most part, intuitive for most people taking the class. I kept studying, multiple C++, Java, and Python courses and in time I ended up tutoring those classes as well. Seeing other's mistakes and misunderstandings was instrumental when taking my studies further...",
